		alsa pass-though (AC-3,E-AC-3,DTS,...) device name
	ALSA_MIXER=default

Setup: /etc/vdr/setup.conf
------
	softhddevice.MakePrimary = 0
	0 = no change, 1 make softhddevice primary at start

	softhddevice.HideMainMenuEntry = 0
	0 = show softhddevice main menu entry, 1 = hide entry

	softhddevice.AudioDelay = 0
	+n or -n ms
	delay audio or delay video

	softhddevice.AudioPassthrough = 0
	0 = none, 1 = PCM, 2 = MPA, 4 = AC-3, 8 = EAC-3, -X disable

	for PCM/AC-3/EAC-3 the pass-through device is used and the audio
	stream is passed undecoded to the output device.
	z.b. 12 = AC-3+EAC-3, 13 = PCM+AC-3+EAC-3
	note: MPA/DTS/TrueHD/... aren't supported yet
	negative values disable passthrough

	softhddevice.AudioDownmix = 0
	0 = none, 1 = downmix
	Use ffmpeg downmix of AC-3/EAC-3 audio to stereo.

	softhddevice.AudioSoftvol = 0
	0 = off, use hardware volume control
	1 = on, use software volume control

	softhddevice.AudioNormalize = 0
	0 = off, 1 = enable audio normalize

	softhddevice.AudioMaxNormalize = 0
	maximal volume factor/1000 of the normalize filter

	softhddevice.AudioCompression = 0
	0 = off, 1 = enable audio compression

	softhddevice.AudioMaxCompression = 0
	maximal volume factor/1000 of the compression filter

	softhddevice.AudioStereoDescent = 0
	reduce volume level (/1000) for stereo sources

	softhddevice.AudioBufferTime = 0
	0 = default (400 ms)
	1 - 1000 = size of the buffer in ms

Commandline:
------------
	Use vdr -h to see the command line arguments supported by the plugin.

    -a audio_device
    -p device for pass-through
    -c audio mixer channel name
    -s set screen size  (hdr for 1280 x 720 else 1920 x 1080)

SVDRP:
------
	PLAY Url    Play the media from the given url.
